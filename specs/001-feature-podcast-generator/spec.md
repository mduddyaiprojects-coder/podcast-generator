# Feature Specification: Podcast Generator

**Feature Branch**: `001-feature-podcast-generator`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Allows user to send a URL, YouTube video, or document through the iOS share sheet and have a podcast generated from the shared content. Podcasts are then made available as episodes through a traditional podcast application"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user who consumes content on my mobile device, I want to easily convert any interesting article, video, or document into a podcast episode that I can listen to while commuting or exercising, so that I can stay informed and entertained without having to read or watch content.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is browsing content on their iPhone, **When** they find an interesting article and tap "Share" then "Send to Podcast Generator", **Then** the system should process the content and generate a podcast episode within 15 minutes

2. **Given** a user shares a YouTube video URL, **When** the system processes the video, **Then** it should extract the audio transcript and create a conversational podcast episode about the video content

3. **Given** a user shares a PDF document, **When** the system processes the document, **Then** it should extract the text content and create a podcast episode discussing the document's key points

4. **Given** a podcast episode has been generated, **When** the user opens their podcast app (Apple Podcasts, Overcast, etc.), **Then** they should see the new episode available for download and playback

5. **Given** a user has generated multiple podcast episodes, **When** they access their podcast feed, **Then** they should see all their episodes organized chronologically with proper metadata

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the shared URL is inaccessible or returns an error?
- How does the system handle very long content (2+ hour videos, 100+ page documents)?
- What happens when the content is in a language other than English?
- How does the system handle content that requires authentication or has paywalls?
- What happens when the audio generation fails due to technical issues?
- How does the system handle duplicate content submissions?
- What happens when the user's storage quota is exceeded?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept content submissions through iOS Share Sheet integration
- **FR-002**: System MUST support three content types: web URLs, YouTube videos, and documents (PDF, Word, etc.)
- **FR-003**: System MUST extract readable text content from all supported content types
- **FR-004**: System MUST convert extracted content into conversational podcast dialogue format
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate high-quality audio from the dialogue script
- **FR-006**: System MUST create a standard RSS podcast feed for each user
- **FR-007**: System MUST make generated episodes available through traditional podcast applications
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide episode metadata including title, description, and duration
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle processing failures gracefully with user notification
- **FR-010**: System MUST support multiple episodes per user feed
- **FR-011**: System MUST preserve original content source information in episode metadata
- **FR-012**: System MUST generate episodes in MP3 format at 128 kbps quality, compatible with podcast players
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide processing status updates to users
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle content that exceeds 1 hour for videos, 50 pages for documents, or 50,000 words for articles
- **FR-015**: System MUST support anonymous access without requiring user registration
- **FR-016**: System MUST retain generated episodes for 90 days
- **FR-017**: System MUST handle up to 10 simultaneous content processing requests
- **FR-018**: System MUST validate content accessibility before processing
- **FR-019**: System MUST provide error messages when content cannot be processed
- **FR-020**: System MUST generate episodes with no more than 15 minutes duration

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Content Submission**: Represents a user's request to convert content into a podcast episode, including the source URL/file, content type, submission timestamp, and processing status
- **Podcast Episode**: Represents a generated audio episode with metadata including title, description, audio file location, duration, source content reference, and publication date
- **User Feed**: Represents a user's personal podcast feed containing all their generated episodes, with RSS feed URL and subscription information
- **Processing Job**: Represents the background task that converts submitted content into a podcast episode, including current status, error information, and processing timestamps
