# Tasks.md Update Summary - Database Deployment Tasks Added

**Date:** September 30, 2025  
**Updated File:** `specs/002-allow-updating-the/tasks.md`  
**New Documentation:** `specs/002-allow-updating-the/T030-T036-database-deployment-guide.md`

---

## What Was Done

I've updated the tasks.md file to include comprehensive database deployment tasks (T030-T036) with detailed step-by-step instructions for an AI agent or human orchestrator to complete the Feature 002 implementation.

---

## Changes Made to tasks.md

### 1. Added New Phase: 3.6 Database Deployment & Final Verification

Added 7 new tasks after T029:

- **T030**: Deploy PostgreSQL database to Azure (create Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server)
- **T031**: Deploy database schema using `database/schemas/003_podcast_generator_azure.sql`
- **T032**: Configure DATABASE_URL environment variable in Azure Function App settings
- **T033**: Verify database connectivity from Azure Function App
- **T034**: Run complete end-to-end verification tests including branding endpoint
- **T035**: Verify RSS feed reflects branding changes (when RSS endpoint is implemented)
- **T036**: Performance verification: monitor database query times and optimize as needed

### 2. Updated T029 Status

Changed T029 from:
```markdown
- [ ] T029 Manual verification: run quickstart checklist end‑to‑end
```

To:
```markdown
- [x] T029 Manual verification: run quickstart checklist end‑to‑end (partially complete - database required)
```

This reflects that T029 was completed as far as possible, but identified database deployment as the blocker.

### 3. Updated Dependencies Section

Added new dependency notes:
- T029 manual verification identified database deployment as blocker
- T030–T033 must be completed sequentially (database → schema → config → verification)
- T034–T036 depend on T030–T033 completion (require operational database)

### 4. Added Detailed Task Instructions

Added comprehensive documentation for each task (T030-T036) including:

#### For Each Task:
- **Objective**: Clear goal statement
- **Prerequisites**: What must be done first
- **Steps**: Numbered, copy-paste commands with explanations
- **Verification**: How to confirm success
- **Expected Outcome**: What success looks like
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and fixes
- **Time Estimates**: How long each task should take

#### Special Sections:
- **Azure CLI commands** ready to copy-paste
- **Connection string formats** with examples
- **Database verification queries**
- **Security considerations** and best practices
- **Cost estimates** ($13-15/month for Burstable tier)
- **Performance targets** and monitoring guidance
- **Final completion checklist**

---

## New Documentation Created

### T030-T036-database-deployment-guide.md

A comprehensive quick-reference guide containing:

#### Overview
- Current status (80% complete, database is blocker)
- What's working vs. what's blocked
- Task summary table with time estimates

#### Deployment Options
**Option 1: AI Agent-Led**
```bash
copilot task --file ./specs/002-allow-updating-the/tasks.md T030
copilot task --file ./specs/002-allow-updating-the/tasks.md T031
# etc...
```

**Option 2: Orchestrator-Led**
- Step-by-step commands for manual execution
- AI agent handles verification only

#### Key Information
- Database schema overview
- Cost estimation ($20-40/month total)
- Security considerations
- Troubleshooting guide
- Verification checklist
- Next steps after completion

---

## How to Use These Tasks

### For AI Agent Execution

Run tasks sequentially:
```bash
copilot task --file ./specs/002-allow-updating-the/tasks.md T030
# Wait for completion, then:
copilot task --file ./specs/002-allow-updating-the/tasks.md T031
# And so on...
```

Each task has enough detail for an AI agent to:
1. Understand the objective
2. Execute the required commands
3. Verify success
4. Handle common errors
5. Document completion

### For Human Orchestrator

If you prefer to control database deployment yourself:

1. **Review** T030-T036-database-deployment-guide.md
2. **Execute** Steps 1-4 (database creation, schema, configuration)
3. **Delegate** verification to AI agent (T033-T034)
4. **Review** performance optimization (T036)

## Database Schema Information

### File Location
`/database/schemas/003_podcast_generator_azure.sql`

### Key Features
- Azure-compatible (uses `gen_random_uuid()` instead of uuid-ossp extension)
- Creates 5 tables: global_feed, content_submissions, podcast_episodes, processing_jobs, user_feeds
- Custom ENUM types for status tracking
- Performance indexes pre-configured
- Default global_feed record with UUID `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`

### Critical for Branding Endpoint
The `global_feed` table is the singleton record that stores:
- title (podcast title)
- artwork_url (podcast image URL)
- updated_at (last modification timestamp)
- Other feed metadata

## Known Issues to Address

From T029 verification, these issues were identified:

1. **Database Not Configured** (Critical - T030-T033 fixes this)
   - Branding endpoint returns 500 errors
   - Must be fixed for Feature 002 completion

2. **Doc Ingestion Health Check Slow** (Medium priority)
   - Sometimes exceeds 5 seconds
   - Should be addressed after database deployment
   - Consider caching or async checks

3. **Image Validation Limited** (Low priority)
   - Only validates URL format, not actual dimensions
   - Full validation requires downloading/inspecting image
   - Can be enhanced in future iteration

4. **No Rate Limiting** (Low priority)
   - All endpoints currently unprotected
   - Should add rate limiting middleware
   - Not blocking for initial release

---

## Security Notes

The detailed task instructions include security best practices:

### During Deployment (T030-T032)
- Use strong generated passwords
- Enable SSL/TLS (sslmode=require)
- Configure firewall to allow only Azure services
- Consider Azure Key Vault for DATABASE_URL

### For Production
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Set up alerts for failed authentications
- Use managed identities where possible
- Regular security audits

---

## Cost Management

### Current Deployment
- **Database**: ~$13-15/month (Burstable tier)
- **Function App**: ~$5-20/month (Consumption plan)
- **Storage**: <$5/month
- **Total**: ~$20-40/month

### Optimization Tips
- Start with Burstable tier, upgrade if needed
- Monitor actual usage in first month
- Set up cost alerts in Azure
- Review query performance to avoid over-provisioning

### Scaling Path
If you need more capacity later:
- Burstable (B1ms) → General Purpose (D2s_v3): ~$100-120/month
- Vertical scaling is easy (just change SKU)
- Horizontal scaling (replicas) available if needed

---

## Questions Answered

Based on your question "do we need to deploy the API prior to this step?":

**Answer**: No, the API is already deployed and live at `podcast-gen-api.azurewebsites.net`. T029 verification confirmed:
- ✅ API is deployed
- ✅ All endpoints accessible
- ✅ Validation logic working
- 🚫 Database is the missing piece

The tasks T030-T036 complete the final piece: deploying and configuring the database so the branding endpoint can function.

---

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Action
1. **Review T030-T036-database-deployment-guide.md** for overview
2. **Choose deployment approach** (AI agent vs. orchestrator-led)
3. **Execute T030-T033** sequentially to deploy database
4. **Run T034** to verify everything works
5. **Complete T036** to establish performance baseline

### For Future Iterations
1. Address doc ingestion health check performance
2. Implement rate limiting
3. Enhance image validation
4. Set up monitoring alerts
5. Document backup/disaster recovery procedures
