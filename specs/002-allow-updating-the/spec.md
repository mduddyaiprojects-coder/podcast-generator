# Feature Specification: Branding Updates, Health Checks, and Content Quality Improvements

**Feature Branch**: `002-allow-updating-the`  
**Created**: 2025-09-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Allow updating the podcast image and title (with proper propagation to feeds). Add a health check to confirm YouTube ingestion is functional (YouTube is a content source, not a publishing target). Add a health check to confirm document ingestion is functional. Add an end-to-end check that the iOS Shortcut is working correctly. Improve the quality of script generation (structure, tone, length). Improve the handling of voice selection (voice styles, fallback, previews)."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"

4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a podcast creator using Podcast Generator, I want to update my show‚Äôs title and image and trust that these changes propagate to all podcast distribution channels, and I want clear health checks for YouTube ingestion (as a content source), document ingestion, and my iOS Shortcut, so that my feed remains accurate and reliable. I also want better episode scripts and voice selection so the episodes sound more polished and consistent.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Branding update ‚Äî title
   - **Given** a creator has an existing podcast feed, **When** they change the podcast title, **Then** the new title appears in their podcast feed and downstream podcast apps upon the next refresh, and all newly generated episodes reflect the new title.
2. Branding update ‚Äî image
   - **Given** a creator uploads a new podcast image that meets Apple Podcasts constraints (square; 1400x1400 to 3000x3000 px; JPEG or PNG; RGB), **When** the change is saved, **Then** the new image is published to the feed and becomes visible in podcast apps within 24 hours.
3. Health check ‚Äî YouTube ingestion
   - **Given** the system is operating normally, **When** a health check is performed, **Then** the YouTube ingestion status reports OK and includes a recent successful ingestion timestamp.
4. Health check ‚Äî document ingestion
   - **Given** the ingestion pipeline is available, **When** a health check is performed, **Then** the document ingestion status reports OK and includes a recent successful ingestion timestamp.
5. End-to-end check ‚Äî iOS Shortcut
   - **Given** a valid iOS Shortcut configuration, **When** the end-to-end check runs in dry‚Äërun mode, **Then** the Shortcut locally validates the workflow without sending content to the server or creating public artifacts, and the system‚Äôs published server heartbeat shows OK with a recent timestamp.
6. Script quality
   - **Given** a typical article or video, **When** a script is generated, **Then** it follows a clear structure (hook/intro, key points, transitions, recap, outro), uses a consistent conversational tone, and targets 12‚Äì20 minutes in duration.
7. Voice selection
   - **Given** voice styles are available, **When** a user selects a preferred style, **Then** they can preview it before use, and if that style is unavailable at generation time, a deterministic fallback is applied and communicated to the user.

### Edge Cases
- Branding changes during active processing jobs (race conditions / partial updates)
- Image not meeting constraints (non-square, too large, unsupported format)
- YouTube API outage or rate limiting during ingestion; health check should degrade gracefully
- Document ingestion source inaccessible or invalid; health should reflect cause
- iOS Shortcut device offline or missing permissions
- Multiple rapid branding updates; last write wins vs. versioning [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
 - Multiple rapid branding updates ‚Äî last‚Äëwrite‚Äëwins applies; the most recent saved change becomes canonical
- Cached feeds or CDNs delaying display in podcast apps

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001 (Branding: Title)**: System MUST allow creators to update the podcast title and persist it as the canonical show title.
- **FR-002 (Branding: Image)**: System MUST allow creators to upload and set a podcast image that meets Apple Podcasts constraints: square aspect; dimensions between 1400x1400 and 3000x3000 pixels; JPEG or PNG format; RGB color space.
- **FR-003 (Propagation: Feeds)**: System MUST propagate updated title and image to the creator‚Äôs podcast feed and make them observable in podcast apps within 24 hours.
- **FR-004 (YouTube Ingestion: Source)**: System MUST support ingesting YouTube links as a content source for podcast generation. The system MUST NOT attempt to publish or update content on YouTube as a distribution channel.
- **FR-005 (Health: YouTube Ingestion)**: System MUST expose a health check indicating whether YouTube ingestion is functional, including current status, a human-readable message, and the timestamp of the last successful ingestion.
- **FR-006 (Health: Document Ingestion)**: System MUST expose a health check indicating whether document ingestion is functional, including current status, a human-readable message, and the timestamp of the last successful ingestion.
- **FR-007 (E2E Check: iOS Shortcut)**: System MUST provide an end‚Äëto‚Äëend check via the iOS Shortcut in dry‚Äërun mode that validates the Shortcut workflow locally without creating or submitting content, and MUST publish a server heartbeat status with an overall state and recent timestamp so the Shortcut can display backend health.
- **FR-016 (Server Heartbeat)**: System MUST publish a heartbeat status indicating overall health (OK/DEGRADED/FAILED) and a recent timestamp, accessible for user visibility and Shortcut verification.
- **FR-008 (Script Quality: Structure)**: System MUST produce scripts that follow a defined structure: intro/hook, 3‚Äì7 key points with transitions, recap, and outro.
- **FR-009 (Script Quality: Tone)**: System MUST produce scripts in a consistent, user-appropriate tone configurable per show, with the default tone set to ‚ÄúEnergetic, conversational, and warm.‚Äù
- **FR-010 (Script Quality: Length)**: System MUST target a consistent episode length range of 12‚Äì20 minutes.
- **FR-011 (Voice Selection: Catalog)**: System MUST present a catalog of voice styles with descriptive labels and language/locale metadata.
- **FR-012 (Voice Selection: Previews)**: System MUST allow users to preview a selected voice style before use.
- **FR-013 (Voice Selection: Fallbacks)**: System MUST define a deterministic fallback policy if the preferred voice is unavailable, and inform the user of the applied fallback.
- **FR-014 (Visibility: Status)**: System MUST surface status and timestamps for health checks and e2e checks to authorized users.
- **FR-015 (Auditability)**: System MUST record when branding changes occur (who/when/what changed) for accountability.
- **FR-017 (Branding Conflicts: LWW)**: For concurrent or rapid branding updates, the system MUST apply a last‚Äëwrite‚Äëwins policy: the change with the latest persisted timestamp becomes the canonical title/image for propagation and publication. In‚Äëflight processing MUST reference the latest branding available at time of feed update/publication.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Podcast Branding**: Represents the show‚Äôs canonical branding, including title, image reference, last updated timestamp, and version/revision information.
- **Distribution Surface**: Represents a destination where the show appears (e.g., RSS feed). Attributes include name, status, last sync, and notes about propagation. YouTube is not a distribution surface; it is a content source for ingestion.
- **Health Check**: Represents a named check (YouTube processing, document ingestion) with fields: status (OK/DEGRADED/FAILED), message, last_success_at, last_checked_at.
- **E2E Check**: Represents an end-to-end Shortcut verification, including status, timestamp, and summary of the verification steps.
- **Voice Profile**: Represents a voice style with id, display name, language/locale, style tags, availability, and preview sample reference.
- **Script Policy**: Represents guidance for structure, tone, and length targets that scripts should adhere to.

## Clarifications
*Decisions captured during specification review*

### Session 2025-09-29
- Propagation to podcast apps: within 24 hours.
- Image constraints (Apple Podcasts): square; 1400x1400 to 3000x3000 px; JPEG or PNG; RGB.
- YouTube ingestion: system supports ingesting YouTube links as a content source only; no publishing or branding changes on YouTube.
- iOS Shortcut E2E: dry‚Äìrun locally with no server submission; server provides a public heartbeat (OK/DEGRADED/FAILED + timestamp) for backend status.
 - Script defaults: 12‚Äì20 minutes; tone = ‚ÄúEnergetic, conversational, and warm.‚Äù
 - Conflict policy: Last‚Äìwrite‚Äìwins for branding changes.

<!-- No pending clarifications at this time. -->
